# supibot-obsolete
This is the snapshot of Supibot as it was seen in version `1.x`. 
This software is currently not being run anywhere, or being worked on at all.

## Warning
This **obsolete** project is published here to serve as a warning and a source of observation of many patterns and choices I have done over time in old Supibot.
Read this repository, see how things work, keep in mind that Supibot 2.x does a lot differently.
See if you can figure out why, but make sure to not make the same mistakes I did.

### Description
 
This version has been deprecated in favour of [Supibot 2.0+](/Supinic/supibot) and actually version controlling on GitHub.
Yes, Supibot versions `<2.0` were not version controlled on GitHub at all.
Don't do that, version control your projects, if at least in a private repository.

### History
Supibot versions `0.x` existed between `2014-08-04 15:36:39` and `2014-08-07 03:46:30` (based on chat logs) as a very simple chat bot programmed in `mIRC`.
Unforunately, I wasn't able to find any source code for these versions.

Supibot version `1.x` existed between `2018-02-12 18:19:40` (first message sent in chat logs after a long pause) and `2019-03-19` (where the source code was archived, and supibot `2.0-rc` was put into use).
This repository contains the version found in archives.

### package.json
If you're looking for it, and can't find it, you're not alone.
There is no `package.json`, but there is a `package-lock.json`.
I don't know why, I couldn't find one in the archives...
I have a bad feeling that `1.x` never actually had a proper package structure.
